INTRODUCTION
------------

The Bundle redirect module provides a simple additional feature to redirect
module https://www.drupal.org/project/redirect. It allows the user to add
redirect from a node. This is similar to the Drupal 7 feature provided by the
redirect module.

The redirects have to be added for a node from the admin page
admin/config/search/redirect on Drupal 8. This module helps to overcome the
issue, by allowing all the redirect operation from the node itself. It works
currently only with node. It could be extended easily to other entities like
taxonomy.
